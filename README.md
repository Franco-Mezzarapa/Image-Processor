# ImageProcessor


This program is meant to turn Bitmap (BMP) images into PNGs and then remove any true black located in the background of the image.
It's meant to be used to remove the black background of sprites for 2D Games.

Thank you Grace for giving me the idea to write it in python and helping me out.
